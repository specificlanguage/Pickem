# Pickem

This is a webapp that's intending to create a small Pick'em organization and competition app to predict who will win a sports game, along with other community features to talk to the community. _Please note that no betting is involved in this app,_ this is just a fun game with ultimately no payouts or money intake involved besides bragging rights.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
_This only contains the Angular web app, a FastAPI Python backend is forthcoming._

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
